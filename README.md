# Mingbai

The first open-source database for easy-to-understand definitions

## About Mingbai

I developed Mingbai from the ground up to help students find easy-to-understand term definitions related to their field of study (Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science, etc.)

I created this website using <b>React</b>, <b>Express</b> and <b>MongoDB</b>.
